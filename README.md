pg-scott
========

This is a Docker image with Ubuntu and PostgreSQL populated with the classical [Scott database](http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/SCOTT) (EMP, DEPT, BONUS, SALGRADE) from [pg-scott.sql](https://github.com/rsp/pg-scott).

It automatically starts the `psql` shell to play with the data interactively.

Three relations are available: `emp`, `dept` and `salgrade`.

For details on the data see [pg-scott](https://github.com/rsp/pg-scott).

**This is a version using [pg-scott.sql](https://github.com/rsp/pg-scott#pg-scottsql).**

Conversion
----------
Converted to the simplest PostgreSQL data types (`integer`, `text` and `date`).
